/**
 * This is an example of the oauth config required to use the implict grant
 * flow aka the client-side flow.
 *
 * This requires no server-to-server interaction at all. The trade-off is you
 * only get access for a limited time and there is no refresh token - after that
 * time expires the user has to log-in again.
 *
 * To use this config copy it to examples/auth-config.js, fill in your clientId and
 * make sure it is loaded via a script tag in examples/index.html.
